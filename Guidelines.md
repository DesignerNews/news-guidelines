# Community Guidelines

### About the Community

Designer News is a large, global community of people working in design and technology or those interested in the topics. Our definition of “designer-friendly content” is very broad and we let the community decide, by voting on stories, whether content is of interest. However, content that is clearly unrelated or purely spam may be deleted.

Design News began as an invitation-only community and was largely self-regulated. The general rules remain the same since DN was first launched: be nice, be thoughtful, and post good stuff. However, factors such as opening up the registration process and the surging growth in the number of users and traffic require us be a bit more specific in the Community Guidelines.

Please remember that these are guidelines only. Specific user activity may be governed as much by the spirit of these guidelines as any specific rule.

### New Members

New accounts will be able to leave comments immediately but will only gain full permissions over a week. To keep the quality of discussions high, members are expected to register under their real names. Both new and existing members are subject to random verification to weed out anonymous accounts and anonymous accounts will be banned. In the future, we may go to another system to verify members’ identities.

URLs are not permitted. Users that post a url as part of their name or business title will be banned.

### Be Nice

- Personal insults are not acceptable.
- Critiques happen. Be respectful and act professionally.
- Disagreements happen. Don't take things personally. Respond to comments respectfully or ignore them.

### Be Thoughtful

You can show your support for a commenter or submitter by upvoting. Make your comments thoughtful.

### Inappropriate Activity

The following is the type of activity that is subject to moderation by DN:

- Registering multiple accounts or dummy accounts.
- Using voting rings either among friends, within a company, or using dummy accounts.
- Using inflammatory, misleading, or click-bait headlines on otherwise acceptable content.
- Attempting to use DN as your collection agency by embarrassing clients or others.
- Using the front page for job postings (use the Job Board instead).
- Any attempt to game the story rankings algorithm.

### Unacceptable content

- Spam
- "Who wants an invite to..." threads.
- List-format articles ("10 ways to...", "30 examples of...", etc.) that are largely advertorial in nature.
- Threads asking for new features (please use the link in the footer instead so as not to clog the Board).
- Offensive or demeaning posts or comments or material that is NSFW. Before you comment, ask yourself if you would say the same thing to the person’s face.

### Acceptable content

- Self-promotion is acceptable; however, see the prohibition against voting rings
- Links to portfolios and nicely designed sites/services are welcome. Consider using the "Site Design:" label if appropriate.
- Answering blog posts with blog posts is fine by us.

### Flagging content

To report spam or other offensive or inappropriate content, please email us at news@layervault.com.

### Moderation

There are different levels of moderation, some manual and others automated. If a post or comment violates the letter or spirit of these guidelines, the following may occur:

- The headline to a story may be edited if it is misleading, inflammatory, or otherwise click-bait, but the content of the story is otherwise acceptable.
- The post may be “sunk.” This is, for example, a standard response to voting ring activity. A story being sunk means that it will not appear on the front page notwithstanding the number of “upvotes” garnered.
- A Member’s account may be suspended for posting spam or unacceptable content, posting anonymously, or multiple violations of the voting ring rule.
- An account may be banned or deleted entirely if it is clearly a spam account or is involved in significant violations of community guidelines. Multiple accounts and dummy accounts may also be deleted.

### Guidelines will evolve

To maintain a great community, members are expected to adhere to the spirit as well as the letter of the Community Guidelines. Also, these guidelines will evolve over time as issues arise. The community is welcome to voice opinions and suggest changes on the [Designer News Guidelines GitHub repo.](https://layervault.com/news/news-guidelines)
